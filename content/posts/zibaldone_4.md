To compartamentalise the zibaldone into it's own site (the same theme
I use for my [zettelkasten](https://azabelmena.github.io/zettelkasten/))
is perhaps one of the better choices for me to take.
(
Not only do I have more control over the zibaldones, they are in their
own seperate space, free to live (relatively) untethered from my main
[website](https://azabelmena.github.io/zettelkasten/), shackled only
by a single {{<sidenote "hyperlink">}}
the truth is this was always the case, but now
I just have a prettier theming and presentation of my thoughts.
{{</sidenote>}}.
